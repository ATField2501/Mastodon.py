Here's some general stuff to keep in mind, and some work that needs to be done

* Mastodon.py tries to work for python2 as well as python3, so avoid things like annotations,
  use requests over urllib, et cetera.

* Current TODOs (2.3 support):
    * Add support for idempotency keys
    * Document error handling better
